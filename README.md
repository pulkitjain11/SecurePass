# SecurePass
Secure Pass is a mobile application which is designed to safely store passwords. With Increasing Internet usage, the need of remembering passwords for each site that we visit is very difficult.
Also Storage of passwords is also a difficult task as if someone gets hold of it, our sensitive data and personal information may get compromised and vulnerable.

Secure pass is a safe way of storing passwords. It uses Bio Metric Authentication and Facial recognition to unlock and sign in to the app. Once the user gets signed in,
he/she can store the passwords safely. The passwords will be first encrypted and then stored into the database. While retreiving the passwords, the user has to enter the 
Secret key which will decrypt the encrypted password and then the user will be able to see the stored password.

This is developed using Java and is currently for Android Only.
